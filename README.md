This group project was carried out as part of the "Video game" elective course at Mines Nancy. The goal of the course was to create a video game from scratch through collaborative programming and design. Students from both an engineering school and an art school were part of the team. "ARTEM Quest" is a 2D top down light-RPG game where the player has to interact with the environment, other characters and an inventory system in order to find the treasure trove hidden around the ARTEM campus. In order to suceed in their quest, the player will also be confronted with a plaftorm mini-game and a "Flappy-Bird" like mini-game. The map of the game was created using a real ARTEM map, whose pixels were algorithmically retrieved and turned into game tiles. The game has some limitations that are perfectible : a short lifespan, really hard mini-games, a lack of minimap / hints plus too many empty spaces and long distances.

The C# code of the game is saved in this respository. There  is code for each level and for each element the player will have to interact with. The link to the full project, runnable on Unity and with all the assets, is above. The project was created with Unity 2019.3.3f1 and compiled on Windows 10 (x64) - Version	10.0.19043 Build 19043.
